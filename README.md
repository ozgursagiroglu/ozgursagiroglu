# Hi, I'm Özgür! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I’ve been working as a full-stack developer for over 10 years based in Turkey. I met coding to develop my projects when I was in high school. I improved my skills in every project. My main focus is on front-end products, but I’ve built mobile applications and back-end systems in different roles and technologies during my career. Since 2019, I’ve been working in contract roles with companies for their projects to develop and optimize.

I attach importance to performance, stabilization, and code quality on projects while I work.
